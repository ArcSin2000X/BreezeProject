## Breeze Privacy Protocol Alpha

We are pleased to announce our community alpha of Breeze Privacy Protocol powered by TumbleBit. We invite you, our community, to try the alpha, contribute and tell us what you think.

We have several configuration options available to cater for those who just want to try the Breeze Wallet by connecting to our cloud ready architecture, up to those who might want to try a full architecture deployment themselves to experience running a full node TumbleBit enabled Breeze Server.

All of the available options run on *testnet*.
 
#### Option One (Simplest)
Download Breeze Wallet with TumbleBit (alpha).  The alpha release is automatically configured to connect to our Cloud Infrastructure and works out-of-the-box with zero configuration.

Here are the [steps](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option1.md)

#### Option Two 
You can follow option one then edit the configuration file to point to another server.  Several of our community members run servers and you can try other servers with this method.

Here are the [steps](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option2.md).

#### Option Three

You can build, compile and run the latest version of Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol.

Here are the [steps for option three](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option3.md).

#### Option Four

A pre configured docker container for tumblebit server is available [here](https://github.com/BreezeHub/BreezeServerBuild).  You can either use this to run a server or go to the next option.

Warning: option five is hardcore! 

#### Option Five (Hardest)
For those who are extra intrepid you can compile each of our architectural components and run the very latest experimental builds.

To do this first build and install a server and client by following the instructions here:

* [Breeze Server](https://github.com/BreezeHub/BreezeServer/tree/alpha-docs)
* [Breeze Client](#option-three) - following the instructions in [option three](#option-three) above.

To connect your client to server follow the step in [option two](#option-two).

Enjoy and please five us feedback, contribute and join us on slack.

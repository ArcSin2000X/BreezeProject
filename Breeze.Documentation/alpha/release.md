## Breeze Privacy Protocol Alpha

We are pleased to announce our community alpha of *Breeze Privacy Protocol powered by TumbleBit*. We invite you to try the alpha, contribute, and tell us what you think. The new version of Breeze Wallet includes a new Privacy page which givs you access to the privacy protocol.

We have several configuration options available to cater for those who just want to try Breeze Wallet by connecting to our cloud ready architecture, up to those who might want to try a full architecture deployment themselves to experience running a full node TumbleBit enabled Breeze Server.

All of the available options run on *testnet*.
 
#### Option One (Simplest) - Run the Breeze Wallet
Download Breeze Wallet with TumbleBit (alpha).  The alpha release is automatically configured to connect to our Cloud Infrastructure and works out-of-the-box with zero configuration.

Here are the [steps](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option1.md).

#### Option Two - Connect Breeze Wallet to any Breeze Server Full Node
You can set up option one then follow these steps to point to another server.  Several of our community members run servers and you can connect to other servers with this method.

Here are the [steps](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option2.md).

#### Option Three - Build Breeze Wallet from Source (for Developers)
You can build, compile and run the latest version of Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol.  This is a good option for developers those who want to take a look at the code, perhaps with a view to [contributing](https://github.com/BreezeHub).

Here are the [steps for option three](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option3.md).

#### Option Four - Host your own Server the easy way.
A pre-configured Docker container for tumblebit server is available [here](https://github.com/BreezeHub/BreezeServerBuild).  You can either use this to run a Breeze Server Node or go to the next option.

Warning: option five is hardcore! 

#### Option Five (Hardcore) - Build Breeze Wallet and the Breeze Server Node
For those who are extra intrepid you can compile each of our architectural components and run the very latest experimental builds.

In this option you can build and install a server and client by following the instructions here:

* [Breeze Server](https://github.com/BreezeHub/BreezeServer/tree/alpha-docs)
* [Breeze Client](#option-three) - following the instructions in [option three](#option-three) above.

To connect your client to your server follow the step in [option two](#option-two).

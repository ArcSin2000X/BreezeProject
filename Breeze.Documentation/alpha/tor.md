## Install and run TOR
To ensure greater privacy while running the Breeze Wallet we enforce running tor.<br>
Follow the instructions for your operating system below.<br>
Note that you will have to run TOR each time you want to start the wallet.<br>

### Windows

Download and install the TOR Expert Bundle for Windows at: [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en)<br>
If you do not know how to make a batch file, have a look [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/263177/how-to-write-a-batch-script-on-windows/). <br>
Unzip the Expert Bundle and create a Windows Batch file inside the Tor folder, containing:
```
tor -cookieauthentication 1 -controlport 9051
```

Run the batch file (run this each time you want to start the wallet).<br>

### macOS

Install homebrew
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

```
tor -cookieauthentication 1 -controlport 9051

## Install and run TOR
To ensure greater privacy while running the Breeze Wallet we enforce running tor.<br />
Follow the instructions for your operating system below.<br />
Note that you will have to run TOR each time you want to start the wallet.<br />

### Windows

Download and install the TOR Expert Bundle for Windows at: [torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en)<br />
Unzip the Expert Bundle and create a Windows Batch file in the Tor folder, containing:
```
tor -controlport 9051 -cookieauthentication 1
```

Run the batch file (run this each time you want to start the wallet).

# Running Breeze Wallet with Breeze Privacy Protocol (alpha)

Use these steps to setup Breeze Wallet that includes the Privacy Protocol.

### Prerequisites
Breeze wallet is dependent on [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [dotnetcore](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).  Please install these frameworks on your system before proceeding.

This process setup tor, which is needed for the privavy protocol.  If you already have tor running you should instead use [option three](https://github.com/BreezeHub/Breeze/blob/tumblebit-alpha/Breeze.Documentation/alpha/option3.md) and setup tor yourself.

* [Node download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [.Net Core download](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

Next download the alpha version of breeze wallet and unzip it to a location of your choosing.

[release matrix here]

Issue the following command inside the Breeze Alpha folder:

```run```

This process will start up tor, a background window and the Breeze Wallet.

The background window communicates progress information that will be integrated into the Privacy user interface in the near future.

# Changing the Breeze Server that your Breeze Wallet uses for Privacy

The uri address used to connect the Breeze Wallet to a Breeze Server is not editable from the user interface in this release.

```
We do not recommend you change your server if you have already started tumbling coins.
```

If you wish to change it, navigate to your NTumbleBit folder and locate the client.conf to change the server address.

The configuration file can be found in the user's home directory at `.ntumblebit/client.conf` or `%appdata%\NTumblebit\client.conf` on Windows.

| OS | NTumbleBit/TestNet/ config parent directory |
| --- | --- |
| Linux                   | /home/\<username\>/.ntumblebit/          |
| Mac OS                  | /Users/\<username\>/.ntumblebit/         |
| Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 | C:\Users\\<username\>\.ntumblebit\       |
| Windows XP              | C:\Documents and Settings\\<username\>\Application Data\.ntumblebit\ |


You will find the tumbler parameter in client.conf and you can edit it with your favorite text editor:

```
# Tumbler Server 
tumbler.server=ctb://01234567890ABCDEF.onion?h=7a87f8d7vd98s7d898d
```

Quit the client and restart for the change to take effect.  You should see the change in the breeze wallet user interface.
